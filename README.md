This was a term project done for CS2078 - Introduction to Deep Learning. 

- Five different deep learning and machine learning algorithms were ran on over 25 Binary Classification datasets.

- Dataset properties were captured including Class Ratio, Number of Categorical Features, Continous Features, Binary Features, Total Number of Features, 
and Ratio of Continous Features to Total Features.

- While attempting to predict algorithm performance with just dataset properties alone was unsuccessful, surprising correlations between dataset properties and algorithm performance were found.

- Detailed results are viewable in the Repository
