## CS2078 - Introduction to Deep Learning Term Project: Efficient Model Selection For Tabular Data

Why has deep learning accelerated far in the vision and text domains but seemingly plateaued in tabular data with categorical features?

- Five different deep learning and machine learning algorithms ran on over 25 tabular, binary classification datasets.

- Dataset properties were captured including Class Ratio, Number of Categorical Features, Continous Features, Binary Features, Total Number of Features, 
and Ratio of Continous Features to Total Features.

- While attempting to predict algorithm performance with just dataset properties alone was unsuccessful, surprising correlations between dataset properties and algorithm performance were found.

- Detailed results viewable in the Repo.
